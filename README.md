## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

A fully interactive macOS-inspired desktop experience featuring a fluid animated Dock with realistic physics. This portfolio includes draggable, resizable application windows like Finder, Safari, Photos, and Terminal packed with smooth GSAP animations.

The interface offers full dark mode support and seamlessly adapts to mobile with an iOS-style layout. Built with modular, reusable components, it showcases a complete window management system with open, close, and focus states for a premium, desktop-like experience in the browser.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>
- **[React](https://reactjs.org)** is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables efficient UI development through its virtual DOM implementation and reusable component architecture with hooks for state and lifecycle management.

- **[GSAP](https://gsap.com)** is a professional-grade JavaScript animation library that delivers high-performance, butter-smooth animations. It provides precise control over sequencing, timing, and complex motion paths with cross-browser compatibility.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development through composable classes. It provides design system consistency with responsive modifiers, state variants, and just-in-time compilation for optimal performance.

- **[React Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org)** is the official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development. It simplifies store setup with reducers, middleware, and includes utilities like createSlice and createAsyncThunk to reduce boilerplate code.

- **[React PDF](https://react-pdf.org)** is a React renderer for creating PDF files on the browser, mobile, and server. It enables generating dynamic PDF documents using familiar React component syntax and JSX-style composition.

- **[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs)** is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.
